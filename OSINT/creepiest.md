# 😱 Creepiest OSINT Examples & Techniques (Real and Shocking Cases)

OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) is powerful — and sometimes terrifying. When used ethically, it's a great tool for security and investigations. But in the wrong hands or when misused, OSINT can get extremely creepy. Here are some of the most chilling examples and techniques:

---

## 1. 🧟‍♂️ Tracking People in Real-Time from Photos
**Method:**
- Someone posts a selfie at a café.
- Use EXIF data (if not stripped)
- Visible clues (signs, reflections, weather)
- Google Street View
- Instagram hashtags

**Result:** Analyst can pinpoint their exact location without any geotag.

**Real Example:** Bellingcat tracked ISIS fighters using photo shadows, dust patterns, and satellite imagery.

## 2. 📹 Finding Someone's House from YouTube Videos
**Method:**
- Blurred house number → irrelevant
- Aerial shot reveals building layout
- A single frame shows a street sign
- Cloud movement + plane noise match weather patterns

**Result:** Viewers track exact house on Google Maps.

**Example:** GeoGuessr creators like GeoWizard have been doxxed using OSINT from vlogs.

## 3. 🌍 Rebuilding a Person’s Entire Life from Social Media
**Method:**
- Start with username → Instagram (photos + friends)
- Facebook → city, birthday
- LinkedIn → job, school
- Zoominfo → email, phone
- Wayback Machine → deleted posts

**Result:** A full dossier without hacking.

- Cross-check with public sound maps

**Result:** Used to find kidnapped victims or live streamers' hidden locations.

## 6. 🛰️ Satellite OSINT for Personal Tracking
**Tools:** Sentinel Hub, SkyWatch, Zoom Earth
