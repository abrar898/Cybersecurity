## 1. Footprinting vs Fingerprinting

**Footprinting**: Passive information gathering about a target (e.g., domains, emails, technologies used).  
**Fingerprinting**: Active identification of a system or service (e.g., OS, web server version).

| Footprinting | Fingerprinting |
|--------------|----------------|
| Passive      | Active         |
| Uses WHOIS, DNS | Uses nmap, banner grabbing |
| Safer/legal  | Can trigger alarms |

# 🖼️ Image Reversing and EXIF Data Analysis in OSINT

This README covers two powerful image-based OSINT techniques: **Reverse Image Search** and **EXIF Data Analysis**. These methods help investigators verify image authenticity, source, and metadata.

---

## 1. 🖼️ Image Reversing (Reverse Image Search)

### 🔍 Definition:
Image reversing is the process of using a reverse image search engine to find the **source**, **history**, or **copies** of an image across the internet.

### 🎯 Purpose in OSINT:
- Identify the original source of an image  
- Track where else the image appears online (forums, social media, news, etc.)  
- Find similar or edited versions of the image  
- Discover the context or detect misinformation/fake news  

### 🔧 Tools Used:
- [Google Reverse Image Search](https://images.google.com)  
- [TinEye](https://tineye.com)  
- Yandex Image Search – Often better at finding people & objects  
- Bing Visual Search  

### 📌 Use Case Example:
You find a photo on Twitter claiming a protest occurred yesterday. Using reverse image search, you discover the **same image was published 3 years ago** in a news article. ✅ This helps debunk misinformation.

---

## 2. 🧾 EXIF Data (Exchangeable Image File Format)

### 🔍 Definition:
EXIF data is **metadata automatically embedded** in an image file (usually by a digital camera or smartphone) that stores details about how, when, and where the image was taken.

### 🧠 Common EXIF Fields:
- Date and time the photo was taken  
- Device model and manufacturer (e.g., iPhone 13 Pro)  
- Camera settings (aperture, shutter speed, ISO)  
- GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude)  
- Software used to edit or process the image  

### 🎯 Purpose in OSINT:
- Track the location where a photo was taken (if GPS is enabled)  
- Learn about the device and software used  
- Identify manipulation (e.g., EXIF shows editing in Photoshop)  
- Cross-reference time/date for timeline building  

### 🔧 Tools to View EXIF Data:
**Online EXIF Viewers:**
- [Exif Regex Info](https://exif.regex.info)
- [FotoForensics](https://fotoforensics.com)

**Command-line Tools:**
- `exiftool` (Linux/Mac/Windows)

**Mobile Apps:**
- EXIF Viewer (Android/iOS)

### ⚠️ Important Notes:
- Many **social media platforms strip EXIF data** when images are uploaded  
- Some tools can **spoof or delete EXIF data** to avoid tracking  

### 📌 Use Case Example:
An image is leaked online. You extract the EXIF data and find GPS coordinates—plug them into Google Maps and pinpoint the **exact building** where the photo was taken.

| Feature              | Image Reversing                   | EXIF Data Analysis                |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Focus**           | Find image source & context       | Extract metadata from image       |
| **Tools**           | Google, Yandex, TinEye            | exiftool, FotoForensics, Regex    |
| **Used For**        | Source tracing, fake news check   | Geolocation, device, timeline     |
| **Data Type**       | Visual image matching             | Embedded metadata                 |
| **OSINT Role**      | Verifying authenticity            | Finding location/timeline/device  |

# 📍 Physical Location OSINT

## 🔍 What is Physical Location OSINT?

**Definition:**  
Physical location OSINT is the process of using open-source data (images, videos, social media, maps, etc.) to determine the **exact or approximate physical location** of a subject.

### 📌 Common Use Cases:
- Cyber investigations  
- Intelligence gathering  
- Journalism (fact-checking)  
- Law enforcement  
- Threat assessment  

---

## 🔍 Key Techniques to Find Physical Location in OSINT

### 1. 🖼️ Image & Video Analysis
- Use landmarks, signs, shadows, terrain, vegetation, etc.  
- Reverse image search to find where the image has appeared before  

**Tools:**
- [Google Images](https://images.google.com)  
- [Yandex Images](https://yandex.com/images/) – good for faces & places  
- [TinEye](https://tineye.com)  

---

### 2. 🧾 EXIF Metadata
- Use EXIF data from images (if available) to find GPS coordinates  

**Tools:**
- `exiftool`  
- [exif.regex.info](https://exif.regex.info)  
- [fotoforensics.com](https://fotoforensics.com)  

**Example:**


---

## 3. Geolocation OSINT

Using visual, metadata, and contextual clues from media to identify real-world locations.

**Usage:** Locating where a photo/video was taken using landmarks, weather, shadows.

**Tools:**
- [SunCalc](https://suncalc.org)
- Google Earth
- OpenStreetMap
- InVID plugin

---

## 4. GeoGuessr (Gamified OSINT)

**GeoGuessr** is a game that drops you in a random location (Street View), and you guess where you are using visual clues.

**Why it matters in OSINT:** Trains your **visual deduction, mapping, and clue analysis** skills.

**Skills Tested:**
- Reading signs, languages, shadows
- Identifying vegetation and terrain
- Estimating based on architecture

---
